## Introduction:
This repository contains the code and results for the quant trading assignment, focusing on 

## Data:
The dataset used for analysis or model training is described below: SPY_2018.csv

The trading agent dataset contains the following columns:

1. **Open:** This column represents the opening price of the financial instrument (e.g., stock, cryptocurrency) at the beginning of the trading period.

2. **High:** The high column denotes the highest price reached by the financial instrument during the trading period.

3. **Low:** This column indicates the lowest price reached by the financial instrument during the trading period.

4. **Close:** The close column represents the closing price of the financial instrument at the end of the trading period.

5. **Adjusted Close:** Adjusted close refers to the closing price of the financial instrument after accounting for any corporate actions, such as dividends, stock splits, or mergers. It provides a more accurate reflection of the instrument's true value.

6. **Volume:** Volume represents the total number of shares or contracts traded during the trading period. It reflects the level of market activity or liquidity for the financial instrument.

These columns provide essential data points for analyzing the price movements, volatility, and trading volume of the financial instrument over time. They are commonly used in technical analysis, quantitative modeling, and algorithmic trading strategies.
